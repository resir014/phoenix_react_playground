# Phoenix+React Playground

> A sample Phoenix+React project that *actually works*.

This repo is originally made as a supplement to [this guide](https://resir014.github.io/blog/2017/08/09/a-phoenix-react-initial-setup-that-actually-works/). Feel free to use this as a base for your Phoenix+React project, however, everything would make sense if you read the original guide first, so probably go do that first. Don't worry, I'll wait.

The commit logs outline steps taken on the aforementioned guide, to make it easier to follow.

## A quick note

This repo has undergone some substantial changes since I wrote the article mentioned above. I've started learning much about Elixir/Phoenix development, and so I've felt that a rewrite of this starter pack is long overdue.

Some changes include:

* upgraded to webpack 4 to make use of the brand-new optimisation strategies included out of the box, all with a smaller configuration file,
* moved all the frontend stuff back inside the `assets/` directory; and also
* upgraded all dependencies to the latest version.

## What's in the ~~box~~ repo

This repo contains a [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) app hooked up to a React frontend, which includes a basic example of your typical React app.

Bundling is done with [webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/). The webpack team have done a great job to improve optimisation efforts as well as reducing the amount of configuration time required in version 4.

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is used as our package manager. It features a robust lockfile which ensures your dependencies are identical across different devices. This is optional, but I recommend it for your own sanity.

Instead of plain JavaScript, we're going to use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which adds additional static typing, which is really helpful for [detecting bugs during compile time](https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/09/19/to-type-or-not-to-type-quantifying-detectable-bugs-in-javascript/).

## Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v8+)
* [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) (v1.6+)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) - optional. You can use `npm` if you want, but it's for your own sanity.

## Getting started

To install dependencies and configure your project:

* Install Elixir dependencies with `mix deps.get`.
* `cd` to the `assets/` directory and run `yarn` (or `npm install`) to install Node.js dependencies.
* Modify the database settings in each `config/` files according to your needs.
* Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup` (this runs `mix ecto.create`, `mix ecto.migrate` and `mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs` in order)

To start your Phoenix server:

* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
